### Deliverables (Draft)

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to see a landing page when I arrive at the website to know Iâ€™m in the right place.
- AAU, I want to see clearly labeled button for starting the game on the landing page, so I can control when I am ready to start.
- AAU, I want to see information and/or instructions about the game so I know how I will play the game.
- AAU, after the game has started, I would like to see a message, or score, showing the number of cards each player has in their hand.
- AAU, after the game has started, I would like a random selection of cards dealt to each player.
- AAU, after the game has started, I want to see clearly labeled button to 'draw' a card - to progress the game.
- AAU, when I click the 'draw' button, I want to see my 'top' card from my hand. After my card is drawn, the computer's card should be shown.
- AAU, after a card is drawn for the player and computer, I would like to see a message that tell's me if I won the turn.
- AAU, after drawing my card, if I won I would like to see my card count increase
- AAU, after drawing my card, if I lost I would like to see my card count decrease
- AAU, after drawing my card, if my card value matches the computer, I would like to see a 'War' message appear on the screen.
- AAU, if 'War' is active I would like to see one card draw (face-down), and a second card drawn face up for each player
- AAU, depending on the outcome of war turn, I would like to see game status message update and player deck counts change.
- AAU, if I run out of cards in my hand (at the start of a turn, or during war turn), I would like to know that the computer 'won' the game.
- AAU, if my opponent run has not cards left (at the start of a turn, or during war turn), I would like to know that I 'won' the game.
- AAU, if either player has won, I want to see a 'game over' message appear and a 'play again?' button replace the current cards.
- AAU, If I click the 'play again' button, I want the game to restart and the deck of cards to be shuffled.
